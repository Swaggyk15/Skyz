Hey guys! I wanted to share Skyz, a physics-based helicopter flight simulator I developed in Unity. The goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of Unity’s physics system while creating a realistic flight experience that mimics the behavior of an actual helicopter.

During my research, I explored helicopters commonly used worldwide and came across the Eurocopter EC130B4—a widely used aircraft in passenger transportation, EMS, law enforcement, and utility missions. I wanted to incorporate real-world physics principles into the simulator to make flight mechanics as authentic as possible.

In this project, I implemented:

Physics-accurate flight controls: Simulated lift, torque-based yaw control, and rotational inertia using Unity’s Rigidbody system.
Dynamic multi-viewpoint camera system: Smooth transitions between four different perspectives for an immersive experience.
Rotor velocity modulation and thrust scaling: Ensured realistic acceleration and deceleration based on throttle input.

Although this project is far from being fully polished, I plan to expand it in the future by adding:

A crash detection system for realistic collision handling.
A cockpit simulation to enhance first-person immersion.
Real-world physics-based terrain to create a dynamic environment where the helicopter can freely navigate.

If you're curious to see the simulator in action, check out the demo video I have:
